# Welcome to Floorplan!

## Why? 
> The app framework that no one asked for but that we all deserve. 
  - not Batman

We are going to say some more stuff here eventually.

## Getting Started

### Get code setup locally
Open up your favorite terminal and got to where you put all of those projects that never get finished.
Then run:
```sh
git clone git@github.com:floorplan/floorplan.git
```
Then change directories to that new folder and install all the dependencies
> All your dependencies are belong to us.
```sh
cd floorplan
npm i
```

### Get firebase
Now most dev environmenst would be ready to go but first we need to setup a firebase console app so we can do all the things.
